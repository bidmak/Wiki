#Samuel

My name is Samuel, and I am a Software Developer. I was born in Lagos State, Nigeria, and studied Bsc Mechanical Engineering at LASU(Lagos State University) before transitioning to a Software Developer. My hobbies are programming, playing football, and traveling. These are things I do almost all the time. For example, I travel during my leave from work and play football on Sundays. As a Software Developer, I believe you know what I do most during my work hours, programming.

I started the path of a Software Developer after my undergraduate studies, I signed up for an online course at "edx.com." 


This is CS50's project 1 from HarvardX.
